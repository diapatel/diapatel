### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## A little about me
Hi! I am Diya Patel and I'm on this exciting journey to explore the fascinating world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Through countless hours of learning and practicing, I aim to hone my skills in problem-solving, coding and all things data. Here on my Github account, I share my learnings and projects. Feel free to go through my repositories and connect with me. I'm always open to fresh opinions and perspectives.

Peace out!
